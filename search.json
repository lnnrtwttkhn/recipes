    "text": "Notes\nThe recipe yields 16 pieces and is also suitable for muffin molds. You can enhance the cake with orange zest, ground nuts, nut butter, chili, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, or cherries. I use soft dates, which are softer than regular dates. If you only have firm dates, soak them in warm water for about 4 hours. I would use a cake pan with a diameter of 18 cm.

Stir tahini and powdered sugar in a bowl until smooth, add lemon juice, and mix well.\nRemove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan until it’s cool enough to transfer to a wire rack. While the cake is still warm, place a large plate under the rack, then poke the cake all over with a skewer, pour the drizzle over it, and let it soak in."
