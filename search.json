Beat the egg yolks with the melted butter, 500 g quark, 250 g sour cream, 250 ml Rama Cremefine, 150 g sugar, pudding powder, and vanilla sugar with the beaters of the electric hand mixer until creamy.\nPour the sour cream mixture onto the dough. Bake the cheesecake in the preheated oven for about 60 minutes. If the surface browns too much, cover the cheesecake with aluminum foil.\nBeat the egg whites with 1 pinch of salt using the (thoroughly cleaned) beaters of the electric hand mixer until stiff, gradually adding 75 g sugar. Spread the meringue on the cheesecake and bake for another 10-15 minutes in the oven. Let the cheesecake with meringue cool and enjoy.\nIf the cake with meringue stands for a while, small golden sugar droplets form on the meringue - a completely natural reaction and a pretty effect. The cheesecake with meringue is therefore also called Tear Cake. For best results, cut the cheesecake with meringue using a knife dipped in hot water."

In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir until the dough comes together, then knead on a floured surface for about 8-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.\n\n\n2. Prepare the Tomato Sauce:\nIn a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant. Add the crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens.\n\n\n3. Assemble the Pizza:\nPreheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). Punch down the dough and divide it into two equal portions. Roll out each portion on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Place the rolled-out dough on a pizza stone or baking sheet. Spread a layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust. Sprinkle the vegan mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce. Arrange the sliced bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, and red onions on top of the cheese.\n\n\n4. Bake the Pizza:\nBake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted. Remove from the oven and garnish with fresh basil leaves and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil."

I personally prefer the peeled and quartered wedge shape.\nPlace the cut potato slices directly into a bowl and mix them well with 4 tablespoons of olive oil, 2 teaspoons of mild paprika powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt. TIP: For variation, you can also mix in 1-2 teaspoons of fresh, chopped rosemary with the potatoes.\nThen spread the potatoes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Make sure they are all spread out separately and not stacked on top of each other.\nThey should then bake for about 30 minutes on the middle rack of the oven or until they are lightly browned and cooked through—just do the fork test or taste test. IMPORTANT NOTE: The baking time will vary depending on the cut, so keep an eye on them. I wish you much joy with my oven potato recipe and enjoy your meal."

Depending on the brand and size of your air fryer, you may have to cook in batches, and your timing may vary, so watch closely.\nMeanwhile, prepare the dip. Add cream cheese, confectioner’s sugar, orange zest, orange juice, and the packaged icing to a small bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until you reach a dipping consistency, about 1 minute.\nDrop the warm pieces into the sugar-cinnamon mixture, and shake. Transfer to a plate or basket, and serve with the dip."

Stir in two teaspoons of the sugar and cook for a further two minutes. Transfer a tablespoon and a half of the mix to a bowl and put to one side. Stir the peanut butter into the pan, then add the coconut milk, lime zest and a litre of water. Bring up to a simmer, then cook on a low heat for 10 minutes.\n\n\n3. Make the noodles & tempeh:\nMeanwhile, make the noodles and tempeh. Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions, then drain in a colander, rinse under cold water and drain again. Add a little oil to the colander, toss to coat the noodles so they don’t stick, then set aside. To cook the tempeh, put two tablespoons of rapeseed oil in a nonstick frying pan on a medium heat and, when hot, add the tempeh mince and fry, stirring often, for five minutes, until crisp and browning. Add the reserved curry paste mix, the remaining teaspoon of sugar and the extra half-teaspoon of salt, fry, stirring, for another three or four minutes, then take off the heat.\n\n\n4. Serve the ramen:\nTo serve, divide the ramen broth between four bowls, then divide the noodles between the bowls. Top with the shredded pak choy, crumbled tempeh and coriander, squeeze the juice of a quarter of a lime over each portion and serve with another lime wedge on the side of each bowl."

Boil for 2 hours, ensuring the can remains fully submerged at all times. IMPORTANT: Never open the can before or during cooking. Remove from heat and let cool completely.\n\n\n2. Prepare the Base:\nCrush the biscuits into fine crumbs (tip: use a freezer bag and rolling pin). Melt the butter and mix thoroughly with the biscuit crumbs. Press the mixture firmly onto a large plate or shallow dish to form a base (approximately 0.5-1cm thick). Refrigerate for 1 hour until firm.\n\n\n3. Assembly:\nOnce the base is firm, spread the layers in this order: Layer 1: Spread the toffee (the cooked condensed milk) evenly over the base Layer 2: Peel and slice the bananas, arrange in a single layer Layer 3: Top with whipped cream (lightly sweetened) Dust with cocoa powder for decoration.\n\n\nTips:\n\nCook multiple cans of condensed milk at once to save time for future pies. Cooked cans have similar shelf life to unopened condensed milk.\nThe toffee doesn’t need to be warmed before use.\nSometimes sugar in the toffee crystallizes - this adds extra crunch.\nButter amount can be adjusted: minimum 50g to hold the base together, can use up to 100g based on preference.\nFor parties or individual servings: Skip the base preparation and layer toffee, bananas, and cream directly on whole biscuits (no butter needed).\n\nLet the pie set for a few hours before serving - the flavors develop better with time."

After the butter is fully dissolved, add 20g of the chopped pistachios. Now put the pistachio brittle on a baking paper and let it cool down. Mix the rest of the pistachios in the blander. Heat up the white chocolate and whipped cream. Add everything (except the brittle) together and whip it up to a ganache. Keep it in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.\nShred the brittle with the blender and mix it under the ganache. Keep the ganache in your refrigerator over night.\nFor the macrons shells mix the grounded almonds and the powdered sugar using the blender. Sieve the mixture until it is a light powder. Mix the egg white until it’s white and fluffy. Slowly add the rest of the sugar. Optional you can add the green food coloring now. Fold the egg white in the almond-sugar mix, until you get a gluey dough.\nFill dough into piping bag. Put baking paper on a tray. Pipe 24 round spots on the paper. Reduce air pockets in the dough by beating on the pan. Leave baking pan for at least 30 minutes in the room. The shells need to be dry. Preheat the oven up to 160°C and bake the macarons shells for at least 13 minutes (depends on the oven, my oven needs 20 minutes).\nLet the macarons shells chill down. Now you can fill them with the ganache and enjoy."

    "text": "Procedure\n\nCook the ramen in boiling salted water for about 4 minutes.\nMeanwhile, peel and finely chop the garlic cloves.\nHeat the plant-based butter in a pan and sauté the garlic. Stir in the chili flakes.\nStir in the brown sugar and dissolve. Add soy sauce and mix in the ramen noodles.\nRemove the pan from heat and stir until the noodles are evenly coated.\nSlice the leek and set it aside for garnish.\nFor the non-vegan version, beat two eggs and cook them in a pan until scrambled. Mix the scrambled eggs with the noodles and serve everything together.\nPREPARING THE AUBERGINES\nWash the aubergines, cut off the ends and cut into 1x1 cm cubes. You can also cut a few thin slices from the aubergine for decoration. Sprinkle with a little salt and leave to stand in a sieve for 1 hour.\nPlace a suitable bowl with a weight (e.g. water) in the sieve to weigh down the aubergines.\nNote: Salting removes water and bitter substances from the aubergines. Even though the bitter substances have been bred out of most types of aubergine nowadays, it is still worth salting them, as this removes water from the aubergine and makes them crispier when deep-frying.\nFOR THE TOMATO SAUCE\nHeat a little olive oil in a pan over a medium heat and add the garlic clove, allowing it to colour and flavour the oil.\nAdd the tomato passata and a pinch of sugar, season with salt and pepper and add the basil leaves. 8. Leave to simmer for approx. 15 mins. Stir occasionally.\nPREPARE THE AUBERGINES\nMeanwhile, deep-fry the aubergine cubes in plenty of sunflower oil until golden brown and then drain well on kitchen paper. Then add to the tomato sauce.\nFOR THE PASTA\nCook the pasta in salted water until al dente, drain and mix with the sauce.\nArrange on plates, sprinkle with the ricotta and serve immediately.\n\nEt viola, enjoy your meal!"

Then add the garlic and ginger and sauté for another minute until fragrant. Finally add the spices and sauté for a few seconds to allow the flavors to develop.\nPlace the lentils in a fine sieve and rinse under cold running water. Then add it to the onion mixture in the pan, pour in the vegetable stock, stir and bring to the boil. Cover and simmer for 8-10 minutes, or until the lentils have absorbed most of the liquid.\nThen add coconut milk and pureed tomatoes (if using) and simmer for another 5-10 minutes, or until the lentils are cooked. (If the sauce is too thick, add a little more broth or coconut milk until the desired consistency is reached). Season with salt, pepper, coconut blossom sugar and lime juice.\nGarnish the dal with a swirl of vegan yogurt, freshly chopped parsley or coriander and sesame seeds or any other topping of your choice. Serve over rice or with vegan naan or aloo paratha. But it also tastes good as a filling for savory pancakes, crepes or tortilla recipes.\n\nEnjoy your meal!"

If, for example, the consistency is not right when adding up the ingredients, simply add water, flour or oat flakes carefully.\nFinally, crumble the mixture onto a baking tray lined with baking paper. The amount given is pretty much enough for a normal-sized tray. There’s no need to worry about the lumps baking together and you can use up all the space.\nPreheat the oven to 160 °C and bake the muesli for about 30 minutes.\nThe baking time can vary depending on how the oven behaves or how tightly you have covered the tray. Just make sure that you take the muesli out when it starts to get a little dark. Don’t be disappointed if it isn’t crispy when you take it out: it will only be really crispy once it has cooled.\nFinally, you can add chocolate, nuts, seeds or dried fruit such as raisins or cranberries to taste."
