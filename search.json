    "text": "Notes\nThe recipe yields 16 pieces and is also suitable for muffin molds. You can enhance the cake with orange zest, ground nuts, nut butter, chili, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, or cherries. I use soft dates, which are softer than regular dates. If you only have firm dates, soak them in warm water for about 4 hours. I would use a cake pan with a diameter of 18 cm.

Feel free to customize your brownies with your favorite mix-ins like dried fruits or seeds.\nEnjoy your homemade vegan brownies!"

Stir tahini and powdered sugar in a bowl until smooth, add lemon juice, and mix well.\nRemove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan until it’s cool enough to transfer to a wire rack. While the cake is still warm, place a large plate under the rack, then poke the cake all over with a skewer, pour the drizzle over it, and let it soak in."

Shape the pieces into “flat cakes” and roll each one in potato starch. Roll out each piece into a thin circle using a rolling pin.\nFill each dough piece with one tbsp of the cabbage mixture. Wet the edge of the circle with some water. Next, fold it into a half circle and pinch the edges together.\nHeat cooking oil in a pan. Add Gyoza for about 3 minutes until they brown on the bottom. Add about half a cup of water mixed with a tbsp of flour to the bottom of the pan. Cover the Gyoza for about 8 minutes and let it simmer. Then remove the top and keep the heat on until the water is gone and a crispy bottom has formed.\nEnjoy!\n\nPro Tipp: The recipes works much faster and makes much more fun when you do it with another person, which is why it is the perfect food for a date or an evening with friends :)"
