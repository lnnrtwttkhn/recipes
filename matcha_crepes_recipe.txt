Matcha Crepes Recipe
Ingredients:
1 cup milk
2 eggs
¾ cup all-purpose flour
1 tbsp matcha powder
1 tbsp sugar
1 tbsp melted butter
½ tsp vanilla extract
Pinch of salt
Instructions:
Blend the batter: In a blender or bowl, whisk together milk, eggs, flour, matcha powder, sugar, melted butter, vanilla, and salt until smooth. Let rest for 10-15 minutes.
Cook the crepes: Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and lightly grease it. Pour about ¼ cup of batter, swirling to coat the pan evenly.
Flip and cook: Cook for about 1 minute until edges lift, then flip and cook for another 30 seconds.
Serve: Stack and serve with whipped cream, fresh fruit, or sweet red bean paste.
