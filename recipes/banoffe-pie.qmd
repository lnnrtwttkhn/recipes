## {{< fa basket-shopping >}} Ingredients

- [ ] 1 can (400ml) sweetened condensed milk
- [ ] 250g HobNobs biscuits (or other crunchy cookies)
- [ ] 75g butter
- [ ] 4 medium bananas
- [ ] 280ml whipping cream
- [ ] Cocoa powder (optional, for decoration)

## {{< fa kitchen-set >}} Procedure

### 1. Prepare the Toffee:

Place the unopened can of condensed milk in a pot and cover completely with water.
Boil for 2 hours, ensuring the can remains fully submerged at all times. IMPORTANT: Never open the can before or during cooking.
Remove from heat and let cool completely.

### 2. Prepare the Base:

Crush the biscuits into fine crumbs (tip: use a freezer bag and rolling pin).
Melt the butter and mix thoroughly with the biscuit crumbs.
Press the mixture firmly onto a large plate or shallow dish to form a base (approximately 0.5-1cm thick).
Refrigerate for 1 hour until firm.

### 3. Assembly:

Once the base is firm, spread the layers in this order:
Layer 1: Spread the toffee (the cooked condensed milk) evenly over the base
Layer 2: Peel and slice the bananas, arrange in a single layer
Layer 3: Top with whipped cream (lightly sweetened)
Dust with cocoa powder for decoration.

### Tips:

- Cook multiple cans of condensed milk at once to save time for future pies. Cooked cans have similar shelf life to unopened condensed milk.
- The toffee doesn't need to be warmed before use.
- Sometimes sugar in the toffee crystallizes - this adds extra crunch.
- Butter amount can be adjusted: minimum 50g to hold the base together, can use up to 100g based on preference.
- For parties or individual servings: Skip the base preparation and layer toffee, bananas, and cream directly on whole biscuits (no butter needed).

Let the pie set for a few hours before serving - the flavors develop better with time.
