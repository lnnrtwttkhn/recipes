## {{< fa basket-shopping >}} Ingredients

- [ ] 1 Cup All Purpose Flour
- [ ] 1 Cup Granulated Sugar
- [ ] 1/2 Cup Cocoa Powder
- [ ] 1 Teaspoon Baking Powder
- [ ] 1/2 Cup Water
- [ ] 1/2 Cup Vegetable Oil or melted Coconut Oil
- [ ] 1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract
- [ ] 1/2 cup vegan chocolate chips (optional)
- [ ] 1/4 Chopped Nuts (optional)

## {{< fa kitchen-set >}} Procedure

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Lightly grease an 8x8-inch baking pan or line it with parchment paper.
2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt until well combined.
3. Add the water, vegetable oil (or melted coconut oil), and vanilla extract to the dry mixture. Stir until the batter is smooth and well combined.
4. If using, fold in the vegan chocolate chips and chopped nuts.
5. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan, spreading it out evenly. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs.
6. Allow the brownies to cool completely in the pan on a wire rack before cutting into squares.
7. Enjoy your vegan brownies plain or with a scoop of vegan ice cream on top!

Tips:

For an extra fudgy texture, reduce the baking time slightly.
Feel free to customize your brownies with your favorite mix-ins like dried fruits or seeds.

Enjoy your homemade vegan brownies!
