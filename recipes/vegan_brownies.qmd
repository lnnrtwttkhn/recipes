Ingredients:

    1 cup all-purpose flour
    1 cup granulated sugar
    1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
    1 teaspoon baking powder
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    1/2 cup water
    1/2 cup vegetable oil or melted coconut oil
    1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    1/2 cup vegan chocolate chips (optional)
    1/4 cup chopped nuts (optional)

Instructions:

    Preheat Oven:
    Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Lightly grease an 8x8-inch baking pan or line it with parchment paper.

    Mix Dry Ingredients:
    In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt until well combined.

    Add Wet Ingredients:
    Add the water, vegetable oil (or melted coconut oil), and vanilla extract to the dry mixture. Stir until the batter is smooth and well combined.

    Fold in Add-ins:
    If using, fold in the vegan chocolate chips and chopped nuts.

    Bake:
    Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan, spreading it out evenly. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs.

    Cool:
    Allow the brownies to cool completely in the pan on a wire rack before cutting into squares.

    Serve:
    Enjoy your vegan brownies plain or with a scoop of vegan ice cream on top!

Tips:

    For an extra fudgy texture, reduce the baking time slightly.
    Feel free to customize your brownies with your favorite mix-ins like dried fruits or seeds.

Enjoy your homemade vegan brownies!
