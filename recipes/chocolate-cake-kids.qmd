1.    Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.

## Notes

The recipe yields 16 pieces and is also suitable for muffin molds. You can enhance the cake with orange zest, ground nuts, nut butter, chili, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, or cherries.
I use soft dates, which are softer than regular dates.
If you only have firm dates, soak them in warm water for about 4 hours.
I would use a cake pan with a diameter of 18 cm.
