## {{< fa basket-shopping >}} Ingredients

### For the Fortune Cookies

-   [ ] Egg white from 3 eggs 
-   [ ] 60g powder sugar
-   [ ] 45g margarine
-   [ ] 60g flour
-   [ ] a pinch of salt 

## {{< fa kitchen-set >}} Procedure

1.  Preheat the oven on 180 degree
2.  Melt the margarine
3.  Beat the egg white with the salt until it is fluffy
4.  Mix the melted margarine with the powder sugar, the fluffy egg white and the flour
5.  Using a spoon, spread a tablespoon of the dough thinly into a circle on a baking tray lined with baking paper (or a suitable alternative). 
6.  Bake it for 5-7 minutes
7.  Now everything has to happen very quickly (it's best if everyone helps): carefully remove the still soft cookies from the paper with a knife and place a prepared note message on top.
8.  Fold the cookies into semicircles and quickly fold them again with the straight side over the edge of a bowl or glass to create the typical fortune cookie shape.

Enjoy your fortune!
