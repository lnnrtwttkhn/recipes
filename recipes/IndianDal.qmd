## {{< fa kitchen-set >}} Procedure

1.  Heat the coconut oil in a pan or pot. Add the chopped onions and sauté for 2-3 minutes until translucent. Then add the garlic and ginger and sauté for another minute until fragrant. Finally add the spices and sauté for a few seconds to allow the flavors to develop. 
2.  Place the lentils in a fine sieve and rinse under cold running water. Then add it to the onion mixture in the pan, pour in the vegetable stock, stir and bring to the boil. Cover and simmer for 8-10 minutes, or until the lentils have absorbed most of the liquid. 
3.  Then add coconut milk and pureed tomatoes (if using) and simmer for another 5-10 minutes, or until the lentils are cooked. (If the sauce is too thick, add a little more broth or coconut milk until the desired consistency is reached). Season with salt, pepper, coconut blossom sugar and lime juice. 
4.  Garnish the dal with a swirl of vegan yogurt, freshly chopped parsley or coriander and sesame seeds or any other topping of your choice. Serve over rice or with vegan naan or aloo paratha. But it also tastes good as a filling for savory pancakes, crepes or tortilla recipes.


Enjoy your meal!
