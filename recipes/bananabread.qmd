### For the cake

- [ ] 125 grams all-purpose flour (unbleached)
- [ ] 125 grams whole wheat or spelt flour

- [ ] 150 grams small seeds (whatever you like/have: sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, walnut kernels, pine nuts, chia seeds, etc.)
- [ ] 1 good pinch of sea salt
- [ ] 1 teaspoon baking powder
- [ ] 3 medium-sized ripe bananas, peeled
- [ ] Zest and juice of 1 lemon
- [ ] 2 tablespoons olive oil
- [ ] 2 tablespoons natural or unsweetened soy yogurt or coconut yogurt

## {{< fa kitchen-set >}} Procedure

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F).
1. Grease a non-stick loaf pan with butter and dust it with flour (if the loaf pan is not non-stick, you can also line it with parchment paper).
1. Combine all the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl - flours, sugar, seeds, salt, and baking powder - and mix well.
1. In another bowl, mash the bananas with a fork (leaving them slightly chunky if desired), then add lemon juice and zest, olive oil, yogurt, and beaten eggs, mixing well.
1. Add the wet ingredients to the bowl of dry ingredients and gently mix - just enough to combine everything.
1. Transfer the mixture into the loaf pan and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
1. Optional: While the cake is baking, prepare the Lemon Drizzle.
Stir tahini and powdered sugar in a bowl until smooth, add lemon juice, and mix well.
1. Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan until it's cool enough to transfer to a wire rack.
While the cake is still warm, place a large plate under the rack, then poke the cake all over with a skewer, pour the drizzle over it, and let it soak in.
