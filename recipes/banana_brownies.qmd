## {{< fa kitchen-set >}} Procedure

1.  Preheat the oven to 180 degrees top/bottom heat (fan oven: 160 degrees). Grease a baking tin (20 cm x 23 cm) with a little butter and dust with flour. For the batter, peel the bananas and mash with a fork to a fine paste.
2.  Finely chop the dark chocolate coating and melt it together with the butter in a metal bowl over a hot water bath. Beat the eggs and sugar until frothy, then mix in the melted chocolate mixture and the oil. Stir in the mashed bananas and vanilla extract.
3.  Mix the flour, cocoa powder and baking powder in a bowl and sieve into the batter. Mix in briefly, then pour into the prepared tin and smooth out.
4.  Bake the brownies in a preheated oven for approx. 30-35 minutes. Leave to cool for at least 2 hours after baking.
