1. Boil the potatoes and eggs and then peel them. When both are cold, cut them into small squares.
2. Take the pickles out of the jar and keep the water, because you need it later. Then cut the pickles and the onion as well in little pieces.
3. Drain the carrots and peas. Cut the carrots in slices.
4. Put the potatoes, pickles, carrots, the onion and the peas into a big bowl.
5. For the sauce mix Miracel Whip with some water from the jar of pickles, salt and pepper. Add a part of this to the bowl.
6. Mix the ingredients in the bowl carefully. If it is to dry, add more of the sauce.
7. Add more salt and pepper according to your taste.
8. To ensure that it tastes really good, you should prepare the salad a few hours before eating it. You can also prepare it one day before.
