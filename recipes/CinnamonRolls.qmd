## {{< fa kitchen-set >}} Preparation

### Prepare the Dough:

1.  In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm milk and instant yeast.
2.  Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.
3.  Add the melted butter, sugar, salt, and egg to the yeast mixture.
4.  Stir until well combined.
5.  Gradually add the flour to the mixture, stirring until a dough forms.
6.  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic.
7.  Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
8.  Prepare the Filling: In a small bowl, mix together the softened butter, brown sugar, and ground cinnamon until well combined.

### Assemble the Rolls:

1.  Once the dough has risen, punch it down and roll it out on a floured surface into a large rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick.
2.  Spread the cinnamon-sugar filling evenly over the dough.
3.  Starting from one long edge, tightly roll up the dough into a log.
4.  Use a sharp knife to cut the log into 12 equal-sized rolls.

#### Bake the Rolls:

1.  Place the rolls in a greased baking dish, leaving a little space between each roll.
2.  Cover the dish with a clean kitchen towel and let the rolls rise for another 30-45 minutes.
3.  Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
4.  Once risen, bake the rolls in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.

### Make the Glaze:

1.  In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract until smooth.
2.  Adjust the consistency by adding more milk if needed.
3.  Serve: Once the rolls are baked, let them cool for a few minutes before drizzling the glaze over the top. Serve warm and enjoy your homemade Zimtschnecken!
