## {{< fa kitchen-set >}} Procedure

1. Prepare the Dough:

In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil.
Stir until the dough comes together, then knead on a floured surface for about 8-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.
Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.

2. Prepare the Tomato Sauce:

In a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant.
Add the crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens.

3. Assemble the Pizza:

Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C).
Punch down the dough and divide it into two equal portions. Roll out each portion on a floured surface to your desired thickness.
Place the rolled-out dough on a pizza stone or baking sheet.
Spread a layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.
Sprinkle the vegan mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.
Arrange the sliced bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, and red onions on top of the cheese.

4. Bake the Pizza:

Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted.
Remove from the oven and garnish with fresh basil leaves and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.
