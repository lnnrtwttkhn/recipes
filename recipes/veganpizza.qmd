## {{< fa kitchen-set >}} Procedure

### 1. Prepare the Dough:

In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil.
Stir until the dough comes together, then knead on a floured surface for about 8-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.
Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.

### 2. Prepare the Tomato Sauce:

In a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant.
Add the crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens.

### 3. Assemble the Pizza:

Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C).
Punch down the dough and divide it into two equal portions. Roll out each portion on a floured surface to your desired thickness.
Place the rolled-out dough on a pizza stone or baking sheet.
Spread a layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.
Sprinkle the vegan mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.
Arrange the sliced bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, and red onions on top of the cheese.

### 4. Bake the Pizza:

Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted.
Remove from the oven and garnish with fresh basil leaves and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.
