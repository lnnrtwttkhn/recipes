Ingredients
1 (12.4 ounce) can refrigerated cinnamon rolls (such as Pillsbury™)

1/4 cup white sugar

1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

4 ounces cream cheese, softened

3/4 cup confectioner's sugar

1 tablespoon freshly grated orange peel

1 tablespoon orange juice

icing from the cinnamon roll package

Directions
Preheat an air fryer to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Add sugar and cinnamon to a large resealable plastic bag, and shake to combine.

Remove the 8 cinnamon rolls from the can, and set icing aside. Cut each roll into 4 equal pieces for a total of 32 bites.

Line the fryer basket with parchment paper. Place the bites in a single layer in the bottom of the basket, cook for 3 minutes, turn over using tongs, and cook until golden brown, another 2 to 3 minutes. Depending on the brand and size of your air fryer, you may have to cook in batches, and your timing may vary, so watch closely.

Meanwhile, prepare the dip. Add cream cheese, confectioner’s sugar, orange zest, orange juice, and the packaged icing to a small bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until you reach a dipping consistency, about 1 minute.

Drop the warm pieces into the sugar-cinnamon mixture, and shake. Transfer to a plate or basket, and serve with the dip.
