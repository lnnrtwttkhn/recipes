2. Sift in the flour, cornstarch and baking powder and pour everything into a greased springform pan (60 g of flour, 50 g of cornstarch, 1 teaspoon of baking powder)
3. Whisk the egg whites and sugar stiff until foamy and spoon onto the batter (2 egg whites, 230 g of sugar)
4. Bake at 175 degrees for about half an hour on the middle to lower rack.
5. Then let the cake cool and cut it in the middle.
6. Place the frozen raspberries on the bottom half, sprinkle with sugar, and then spread the whipped cream (600 g of frozen raspberries, 40 g of sugar, 0.5 liters of whipped cream)
7. Place the top half of the cake on the filling and let it stand for a few hours (not in the refrigerator). Alternatively, you can thaw the raspberries beforehand if there is not enough time.
